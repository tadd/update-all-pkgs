# First of all, there is one bad news: you cannot update everything in this script.
# Below is my current status and methods.
#
# * System pacakges: apt update && apt upgrade
# * Firmware: fwupdgmr refresh && fwupdgmr update
# * Chrome, Firefox, and Thunderbird: they won't be updated unless booted (maybe?)
#   if you installed binary from upstreams
# * Emacs itself: using distro's package
# * Node.js: 3rd party's APT repositry https://github.com/nodesource/distributions
#     * But you'll need to edit the source file for every major-update
# * Ruby: `git pull && make` (just my preference)
# * TeXLive itself: manual installation annually https://www.tug.org/texlive/
# * Zoom, bat, delta, ...: automated with local APT repository
#     * See https://github.com/tadd/local-apt-repos

# Anyway, let's get started.

# Well done! You did hard work.
