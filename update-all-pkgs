# First of all, there is one bad news: you cannot update everything in this script.
# Below is my current status and methods.
#
# * System pacakges: apt update && apt upgrade
# * Firmware: fwupdgmr refresh && fwupdgmr update
# * Chrome, Firefox, and Thunderbird: they won't be updated unless booted (maybe?)
#   if you installed binary from upstreams
# * Emacs itself: using distro's package
# * Node.js: 3rd party's APT repositry https://github.com/nodesource/distributions
#     * But you'll need to edit the source file for every major-update
# * Ruby: `git pull && make` (just my preference)
# * TeXLive itself: manual installation annually https://www.tug.org/texlive/
# * Zoom, bat, delta, ...: automated with local APT repository
#     * See https://github.com/tadd/local-apt-repos

# Anyway, let's get started.

# Emacs packages, requires `auto-pacakge-update` package
emacs -Q --batch --eval '(progn(package-initialize)(auto-package-update-now))' &
# Ruby: gems
(gem update --system && gem update && gem clean) &
# TeXLive: LaTeX pacakges
tlmgr update --self --all &
# JavaScript: npms
npm --no-progress -g update &
# Rust: toolchain and `cargo install`-ed packages, needs crate `cargo-update`
(rustup self update && rustup update && cargo install-update -a) &
# Rust (again): update single binary `rust-analyzer` with my local script
which update-rust-analyzer >/dev/null && update-rust-analyzer &
# Flatpaks
flatpak update -y &

# Everything is started, time will solve everything.
# It may take a long time, so now you can have some tea or coffee.
wait

# Well done! You did hard work.
# But I'd like to add one thing: what the hell??
